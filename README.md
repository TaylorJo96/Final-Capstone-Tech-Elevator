# Final Capstone

This is a full-stack .NET core application made using Vue as a front-end framework.
We worked in teams of 4 and completed this project in 2 weeks and then did an open house and presented our applications to the public and our peers.


On this project we worked with a Product owner to create a golf application that users could use to interact with other players, keep track of scores and averages, schedule matches, and more.

I am proud of the work we completed on this project but this was my first full-stack application I created from scratch so it probably would not fit my current coding standards. Aside from that, I think this project was an incredible feat and it is amazing that we were able to build this in just 2 weeks on our own.
